# 5. Static Checks in Safe Regions (the soundness core)

Within a safe context, the compiler guarantees (for the supported subset)
the following properties:

## 5.1 Ownership & Move
- Every value has a unique owner.
- After `std::move(x)`, `x` enters the *moved-out* state; reading a
  moved-out value -> error.
- Reassignment returns a variable to the *initialized* state.
- At end of scope, values still *initialized* are dropped; moved-out values
  are not dropped.

## 5.2 Borrow & Aliasing
- **Alias XOR mutability**: at any instant an object may have either any
  number of `const T&` (shared borrows), or exactly one `T&` (mutable
  borrow), never both.
- While an active borrow exists, the borrowed object may not be moved or
  destroyed.

## 5.3 Lifetime
- A borrow must not outlive the borrowed value (**no dangling
  references**).
- v0.1 performs **intraprocedural borrow checking only**, based on
  NLL-style dataflow analysis (liveness-driven region inference).
- **No lifetime syntax is exposed.** Cross-function signatures use the
  following **elision defaults** (a simplified version of Rust's lifetime
  elision):
  - If a function has exactly one reference input parameter, all reference
    outputs borrow from its lifetime.
  - If there is a `this` and the function returns a reference, the output
    borrows from `this`'s lifetime.
  - Any other case that cannot be inferred -> error, advising "this
    signature is not yet supported; refactor or return by value / smart
    pointer". (No explicit annotation syntax is introduced in v0.1.)

## 5.4 Initialization
- scpp has **no concept of an "uninitialized variable"**: any local or
  member that has no explicit initializer is always guaranteed by the
  compiler to be **zero-initialized** (bitwise) -- scalars become `0` /
  `false` / `0.0`, raw pointers become `nullptr`, and aggregate types like
  `struct`, arrays, and `std::unique_ptr` are zeroed field-by-field /
  element-by-element (see [§4.1](ch04-struct-vs-class.md) for `struct`'s
  specific rules). This applies uniformly to every type, not just a
  special case for some of them.
- Reading an uninitialized variable is therefore **structurally
  impossible**: a variable is well-defined from the moment it's declared,
  with no flow-sensitive dataflow analysis needed to prove "every path
  initializes it before use".
- This differs from both Rust (requires explicit initialization; reading
  an uninitialized value is a compile error) and ordinary C++ (no
  initialization by default; reading is undefined behavior): scpp always
  provides a well-defined default value, leaving "is this default value
  the one you wanted" up to the programmer.

## 5.5 Prohibited in Safe Regions (unless in `unsafe { }`)
- Raw pointer dereference, pointer arithmetic.
- `reinterpret_cast`, C-style casts to incompatible types.
- (Untagged) `union`.
- Raw `new` / `delete`.
- Access to mutable global/static variables.
- Calling a function not annotated `safe`.
